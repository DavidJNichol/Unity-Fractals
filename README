Unity Fractals - Final for Graphics Application Programming Fall 2020. 
The goal is to generate procedural fractals with ECS optimization, hopefully utilizing ray marching

Commit 1 - Generates cuboid fractals with 2 colors signifying depth. Uses simple batching. Able to produce a depth of 5 (5 child cubes generated per cube) before performance takes a big hit on a GTX 1080. 
Commit 2 - Added more colors that interpolate. Improved batching amount. Generates both cubes and spheres on a random basis. Able to produce a depth of 6 before performance drops.
